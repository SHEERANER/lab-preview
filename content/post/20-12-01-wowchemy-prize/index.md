Innovation, adaptation, inclusivity, and originality – this set of beliefs has led the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) to make great strides progressively in education, research, and knowledge transfer since its establishment in 1991. In just three decades, HKUST has risen through the ranks in the global educational arena and is recognized as one of the top young universities in the world.

Deeply rooted in Hong Kong, HKUST has a role to play in advancing the sustainable development of the city in the fast-changing digital era. While Hong Kong enjoys international status as one of the world’s most open and dynamic economies and has built close ties with Chinese mainland, it needs to forge stronger partnerships between academic and industry to help the city keep pace with the latest innovation and technology trends and facilitate innovators to put new ideas into action.

Seeing the unprecedented demand for high-end talent in support of the development of Hong Kong and the world, HKUST is looking to push the boundary and forge bridges across disciplines to develop leaders who aspire to make a difference. Like its fellow institutions around the globe, HKUST strives to think forward and reinvent education that defies the boundaries of traditional fields and opens up new frontiers of knowledge and research to address unfolding needs of the wider society. 

The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) (HKUST(GZ)) indeed is the realization of this ambition to transform education for the future, with its cross-disciplinary academic structure designed to complement the well-established disciplinary foundation at the Clear Water Bay campus.  

This vision of transforming the future fits well to the master plan of the development of the Greater Bay Area (GBA) which will serve as a strategic hub to catalyze the combined talents of the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macao, and nine cities in Guangdong Province. The initiative will also strengthen knowledge transfer to bridge Hong Kong’s gap in high-tech manufacturing through the strong mainland supply chain network. 

To conceive this new vision of HKUST, the University signed a tripartite agreement with the Guangzhou Municipal Government and Guangzhou University in 2018. Under the agreement, the University will jointly establish HKUST(GZ) in the Nansha district of Guangzhou with full support of the local authority and partner. With the preparatory approval already obtained in 2019, HKUST is vigorously progressing to the next phase of this important milestone. 

**Greater Bay Area**
The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area (Greater Bay Area) comprises the two Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macao, and the nine municipalities of Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Foshan, Huizhou, Dongguan, Zhongshan, Jiangmen and Zhaoqing in Guangdong Province. The total area is around 56,000 sq. km. At end 2019, the total population is over 72 million, the GDP is USD 1,679.5 billion and GDP per capita is USD 23,371.

The development of the Greater Bay Area is accorded the status of key strategic planning in the country's development blueprint, having great significance in the country's implementation of innovation-driven development and commitment to reform and opening-up. The objectives are to further deepen cooperation amongst Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau, fully leverage the composite advantages of the three places, facilitate in-depth integration within the region, and promote coordinated regional economic development, with a view to developing an international first-class bay area ideal for living, working and travelling.
