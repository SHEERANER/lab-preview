Dr. Shaojun Tang is an Assistant Professor in Division of Life Science, Hong Kong University of Science & Technology (HKUST), and in Bioscience and Biomedical Engineer Thrust, Hong Kong University of Science & Technology-Guangzhou (HKUST-GZ). After graduating with his bachelor’s degree from the Sun Yat-Sen University, he went on to USA and obtained his M.Sc. in Computer Science and Ph.D. in Bioinformatics at the University of Florida. He worked as a Postdoctoral Research Scientist in Boston Children’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School. Before joining HKUST, Dr. Tang worked in Georgetown University as an assistant professor in Bioinformatics. Dr. Tang has been focusing on the study of complex diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune diseases and cancers using high-throughput proteomics, transcriptomics and image data. His current interests also include the development of computational methods and machine learning approaches in biology and to enable precision medicine.

**Research Question**
<br>
Recent development of high-throughput genomic sequencing and LC-MS/MS proteomics enables us to construct high-resolution transcription & translation landscape and identify novel biomarkers in areas such as cancer, autoimmune disease, and neurological disorder. Interpretation of the molecular mechanism of disease development is frequently made in transcriptomics, epigenomics and proteomics levels, respectively. Efficient integration of these multi-omics data to draw a more comprehensive view of biological process is still lacking. As the search for more effective diagnostic markers for cancer, autoimmune disease and neurological disorders continues, key questions to be addressed include:
<br>
a) how to understand perturbations in immune gene signatures and pathways that reflect cancer and autoimmune disease dynamic changes; 
<br>
b) how to integrate epigenomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data to improve our ability to identify crucial disease networks;
<br>
c) hot wo disentangle heterogenous data to support a better understanding of biological systems and the development of robust precision medicine.

**Research Approaches**
<br>
A combination of high-throughput RNA-Sequencing including scRNA-seq differential expression, LC-MS/MS protein quantification and Post-Translational Modification (PTM) will be employed to investigate the gene expression, protein abundance, PTM and interaction network in whole-blood, PBMC, and tissues from cancer study and neurological disorders. The ultimately goal is to build innovative multi-omics data analysis & integration computational methods, construct proteogenomic expression landscape and regulatory networks, and facilitate the development of prognostic biomarkers, the interpretation of complex disease, and enabling precision medicine.
