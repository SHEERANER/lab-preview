abstract: Background and Aim It has been well documented that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is a risk factor for aggravating gastric mucosal atrophy. However, the exact molecular mechanism mediating this process is not fully elucidated. The purpose of this study was to identify biomarkers, which may predict the risk for progression of chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) with H. pylori. Methods GSE27411 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between H. pylori-infected samples without CAG and H. pylori-infected CAG samples were analyzed. Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment analyses were performed, followed by protein–protein interaction network construction. We used immunohistochemistry analysis to identify DEGs in 20 chronic gastritis, 20 CAG, and 22 gastric cancer (GC) specimens. Results A total of 303 upregulated and 26 downregulated DEGs were identified. The pathways enriched by upregulated DEGs were mainly related to fat digestion and absorption, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling pathway, and chemical carcinogenesis. Cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) had the highest degrees in protein–protein interaction network. Moreover, the positive rates of CYP3A4 protein expression in chronic gastritis, CAG, and GC were 10% (2/20), 55% (11/20), and 77.3% (17/22), respectively (P < 0.001). The Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed that elevated expression of CYP3A4 was significantly associated with worse overall survival and first progression, respectively (P < 0.0001). Conclusion According to the findings of this study, the expression of CYP3A4 might be related to the potential carcinogenic transformation of CAG to GC. Therefore, CYP3A4 may be biomarkers to predict progression of CAG and poor prognosis of gastric cancer.
