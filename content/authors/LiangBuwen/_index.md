LIANG Buwen is a Ph.D student at HKUST(GZ), supervised by Prof. Tang.

He mainly focus on two aspects:

1) I would like to develope quantitative models and computational methods for analyzing high-throughput data generated from emerging genomics technologies.
<br>
2) I would like to explore how to use deep learning algorithms to study epigenetics in human diseases, such as cancer and Alzheimer's Disease.

Please view my personal web if you want to learn more about myself: https://lbw124765283.github.io/bwliang.github.io/
